## Usage

Install the monitor module with npm, in your project:

```bash
> npm i --save pm2-server-monitor
```

Use the module in top of your project code:

```js
const monitor = require('pm2-server-monitor');
monitor({
    // your server name, as a flag
    name: 'local',

    // your server listening port
    port: 3001
});
```
*Your can view the `./example` folder for reference.*

Start your server with PM2, don't forget the `--no-treekill` argument:

```bash
> pm2 start bin/www -i max --no-treekill
```

Add the servers info in `./webUI/config.js` file:

```js
const servers = {
    'local': [{
        ip: '127.0.0.1',
        port: 3001,
        show: false
    }]
}
```

Open `./webUI/index.html` to see the monitor UI.

**Note:** you can put the `./webUI` folder anywhere, it has zero dependencies.

Enjoy it :)
